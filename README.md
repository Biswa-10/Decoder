# Decoder
Decode a secret message by applying Markov Chain and Monte Carlo simulations. 

The project assumes that the coded language is in English and has a one to one mapping from symbols in encoded message to the letters of English alphabet. From a random initial guaess we tend to converge to the decoded message by using the data obtained from the calculated first order transition matrix of english language.
